# Enterprise Architecture Model

## Architecture Portal – Enterprise Architecture Model

The Enterprise Architecture Model is a graphic display of the artefacts which support the Organisation’s Enterprise Architecture. Behind the model is a flexible framework which enables any organisation to define its own artefacts and groupings. 

EA Artefacts are grouped into Domains (or “Dimensions”). The Domains can be set to display in a specific order on the page. 

Clicking on an artefact navigates to a detail page for that artefact. The details page holds a description, links to other web based resources, and the outcome of a “health” assessment (if these have been recorded). 

A Health Assessment can be recorded against any artefact and utilises the Health Assessment framework within the Portal. This framework and associated health assessments are the subject of a separate “How to” guide. 

This Enterprise Architecture Model is based on the Government Enterprise Architecture for New Zealand (GEA-NZ) Framework and uses the same Dimensions/Domains.
