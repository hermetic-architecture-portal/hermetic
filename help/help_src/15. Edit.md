## Architecture Portal – Editing Data

Edits to data within the Architecture Portal are live once saved. It is important that any change to the Portal is saved immediately and frequently, or the change may be lost. When two or more people are editing the same item simultaneously (e.g. two people editing “Adobe” under the Technologies entity at the same time), only the most recent save is recorded. This is not an issue when different items are edited simultaneously (e.g. one person editing “Adobe” and one person editing “Android” under the Technologies entity at the same time).
