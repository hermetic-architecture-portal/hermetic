# <b> Edit - Network Models</b>
<h2> Architecture Portal – Editing Network Models </h2>

<h4> What are “Networks” in the Portal? </h4>

<i> Note: refer to the Architecture Portal editing guide for help on how to edit data in the portal. </i>

A “network” describes the nodes and servers, and their relationships and connections and their positioning within security zones and displays them as a diagram in the Portal. Networks are normally constructed in the context of an application but could equally represent any collection of servers which provide a service. 

A network is made up of nodes, servers, network zones and connections. In order to make the network models flexible and easy to maintain when actual servers are changed, added or removed, the Portal uses the concept of “abstract” network nodes which are placeholders in the network for actual servers (which could be physical or virtual). Abstract nodes tend to be the same for all environments for an application (e.g. dev, test, prod), and are implemented through different servers in the physical or virtual environments. 

Networks are displayed in the context of technologies. To see a network attached to, say, a specific application, a user would go to the detail page for the application (through the Business Reference Model, the Application Reference Model, or the Technology List), and select the “Technical” link in the left hand panel. 

<h4>How do I Create a Network? </h4>

It’s important to know what the network looks like before you start – this will minimise errors and potential re-work in the Portal. 

<h4>Step 1: Create “abstract” Network Nodes</h4>

These are not actual server nodes but merely represent a server or cluster of servers as seen from the network perspective. Abstract nodes would typically be used where there are multiple servers performing the same function e.g. 5 front end servers serving up an application through a load balancer. Using abstract nodes keeps the diagram relatively simple, while the details of actual servers is stored in the background and can be viewed in the portal by drilling down in to the abstract node. 

These are then “implemented” by actual physical or virtual servers.

    <td>This is mandatory for abstract nodes. The portal will draw network nodes together in the network zones specified by this Location. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Implements nodes</td>
    <td>For a non-abstract node (e.g. a real physical or virtual server), this defines which abstract node(s) is/are implemented by the server.</td>
    <td>Does not apply to abstract nodes (an abstract node cannot implement another abstract node)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Environment ID</td>
    <td>Defines which environment a non-abstract node is part of e.g. test, development, production. Values come from a lookup table of “Deployment Environments”.</td>
    <td>Does not apply to abstract nodes as they are assumed to be constant across all environments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Technologies</td>
    <td>Defines which technologies the network node supports.</td>
    <td>Can be multiple technologies but would normally only be a single one. Abstract nodes must be linked to the technology (application) which they support.</td>
</tr>
</table>

The use of abstract nodes means that the actual servers which implement the function of the abstract node can be changed easily. 

<h4>Step 2: Create actual Network Nodes </h4>
These are the physical and virtual infrastructure components etc. which actually implement the application.

    <td>Implements nodes</td>
    <td>For a non-abstract node (e.g. a real physical or virtual server), this defines which abstract node(s) is/are implemented by the server.</td>
    <td>Only applies if this node is implementing an abstract node. If not implementing an abstract node, leave blank. </td>

</tr>
</table>

Note, these can be used directly, without the use of abstract nodes, particularly where there is no redundancy implemented or intended, but where more than one server is to be deployed to fulfil a task in the network then abstract nodes are recommended to both simplify the diagram and to make maintenance easier. 

<h4>Step 3: Create network connections</h4> 
Once the network nodes have been created, then they need to be linked. 
This gives the opportunity to add protocols and network ports.
