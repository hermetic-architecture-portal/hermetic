# Edit - Network Models
## Architecture Portal – Editing Network Models

### What are “Networks” in the Portal?

*Note: refer to the Architecture Portal editing guide for help on how to edit data in the portal.*

A “network” describes the nodes and servers, and their relationships and connections and their positioning within security zones and displays them as a diagram in the Portal. Networks are normally constructed in the context of an application but could equally represent any collection of servers which provide a service. 

A network is made up of nodes, servers, network zones and connections. In order to make the network models flexible and easy to maintain when actual servers are changed, added or removed, the Portal uses the concept of “abstract” network nodes which are placeholders in the network for actual servers (which could be physical or virtual). Abstract nodes tend to be the same for all environments for an application (e.g. dev, test, prod), and are implemented through different servers in the physical or virtual environments. 

Networks are displayed in the context of technologies. To see a network attached to, say, a specific application, a user would go to the detail page for the application (through the Business Reference Model, the Application Reference Model, or the Technology List), and select the “Technical” link in the left hand panel. 

## How do I Create a Network?

It’s important to know what the network looks like before you start – this will minimise errors and potential re-work in the Portal. 

### Step 1: Create “abstract” Network Nodes

These are not actual server nodes but merely represent a server or cluster of servers as seen from the network perspective. Abstract nodes would typically be used where there are multiple servers performing the same function e.g. 5 front end servers serving up an application through a load balancer. Using abstract nodes keeps the diagram relatively simple, while the details of actual servers is stored in the background and can be viewed in the portal by drilling down in to the abstract node. 

These are then “implemented” by actual physical or virtual servers. 

| Field | Description | Comment |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Node ID | Unique internal identifier for the Node – alphanumeric up to ** chars | Case sensitive |
| Is abstract node | Checkbox – checking this indicates that this is an abstract node. | The portal will expect “actual”, non-abstract nodes to be linked to this node later (although this is not mandatory – a network diagram could just exist as a set of abstract nodes but its usefulness would be limited) |
| Node type | Defines what type of network component this node represents. Current options are: Database, Desktop, Mobile device, Cluster, Load balancer, Load balancer alias, Server  | Other values can be added but the portal will not understand what they are and will not draw the appropriate symbol. |
| Location ID | Indicates the network zone in which this node resides. Values come from a lookup table of “Network Locations” | This is mandatory for abstract nodes. The portal will draw network nodes together in the network zones specified by this Location. |
| Implements nodes | For a non-abstract node (e.g. a real physical or virtual server), this defines which abstract node(s) is/are implemented by the server. | Does not apply to abstract nodes (an abstract node cannot implement another abstract node) |
| Environment ID | Defines which environment a non-abstract node is part of e.g. test, development, production. Values come from a lookup table of “Deployment Environments”. | Does not apply to abstract nodes as they are assumed to be constant across all environments. |
| Technologies | Defines which technologies the network node supports. | Can be multiple technologies but would normally only be a single one. Abstract nodes must be linked to the technology (application) which they support. |
|

The use of abstract nodes means that the actual servers which implement the function of the abstract node can be changed easily. 

### Step 2: Create actual Network Nodes
These are the physical and virtual infrastructure components etc. which actually implement the application. 

| Field | Description | Comment |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Node ID | Unique internal identifier for the Node – alphanumeric up to ** chars | Case sensitive |
| Is abstract node | Checkbox – leaving this unchecked indicates that this is a non-abstract node (i.e. a real object). |  |
| Node type | Defines what type of network component this node represents. Current options are: Database, Desktop, Mobile device, Cluster, Load balancer, Load balancer alias, Server |  Other values can be added but the portal will not understand what they are and will not draw the appropriate symbol. Not required if this node is implementing an abstract node (it will inherit whatever was entered for the abstract node)  |
| Location ID | Indicates the network zone in which this node resides. Values come from a lookup table of “Network Locations” | If this node is implementing an abstract node, leave this blank (it will inherit whatever was entered for the abstract node). If it isn’t implementing an abstract node then it should be filled in. The portal will draw network nodes together in the network zones specified by this Location. |
| Implements nodes | For a non-abstract node (e.g. a real physical or virtual server), this defines which abstract node(s) is/are implemented by the server. | Only applies if this node is implementing an abstract node. If not implementing an abstract node, leave blank. |
| Environment ID | Defines which environment a non-abstract node is part of e.g. test, development, production. Values come from a lookup table of “Deployment Environments” | Mandatory for a non-abstract node. |
| Technologies | Defines which technologies the network node supports. |If this node is implementing an abstract node, leave this field blank (it will inherit whatever was entered for the abstract node). If not, then link to the technology (application) which it supports. Can be multiple technologies but would normally only be a single one. |
|

Note, these can be used directly, without the use of abstract nodes, particularly where there is no redundancy implemented or intended, but where more than one server is to be deployed to fulfil a task in the network then abstract nodes are recommended to both simplify the diagram and to make maintenance easier. 

### Step 3: Create network connections
Once the network nodes have been created, then they need to be linked. 
This gives the opportunity to add protocols and network ports. 

| Field | Description | Comment |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| From Node Id | The node which requests data from another node |  |
| To Node Id | The node which receives and processes requests |  |
| Summary | Very brief summary of the connection. | This can appear as diagrams drawn in the portal |
| Description | Long text description of the nature and purpose of the connection. |  |
| Protocol | The protocol used for the connections e.g. TCP, HTTP | This can appear as a diagram drawn in the portal |
| Port | The ports used on the servers at the target end of the connection | This can appear as a diagram drawn in the portal |
| Technologies | Can link none, one or more technologies to a network connection. | Not used by the portal. |
