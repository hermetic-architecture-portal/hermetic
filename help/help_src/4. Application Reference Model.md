# Application Reference Model

## Architecture Portal – Application Reference Model 

The Application Reference Model is a graphic display of the Application Architecture of an organisation. It presents all those applications which are significant to the organisation in a single place and groups them into domains and sub-categories within each domain. 

By default, the model will display all applications which have been assigned to an application domain. The applications can be filtered by application category e.g. enterprise, local, platform. This filter restricts the applications which are displayed in the model to a single category. 

Clicking on the “Overlays: Health” checkbox displays the result of a health assessment as a colour coded heat map applied to the applications. 

Clicking on an application navigates to the application detail page.
