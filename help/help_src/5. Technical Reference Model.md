# <b> Technical Reference Model</b>

<h2> Architecture Portal – Technical Reference Model </h2>

The Technical Reference Model is a graphic display of the Technical Architecture of an organisation. It represents all the core sub-user-application technologies which support the organisation, arranged in logical groups. 

It is designed to visualise the whole technology stack which supports the organisation and generally sits below the application level. 

The model can show the results of health assessments and can indicate preferred options where there are several technologies performing similar functions. 

The model has functionality which is controlled by options in the Function Bar. The function bar is located at the top of the model display.

Clicking on a technology navigates to the Technology detail page.
